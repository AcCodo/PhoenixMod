Whenever you hit an enemy with Press The Witness while holding a decisive piece of evidence, gain a stack of turnabout, if you have 50 stacks of turnabout, Phoenix will enter turnabout mode, replacing Phoenix's primary and secondary abilities with empowered versions.

## Changelog

- 1.0.0 - Initial Release
 
## Future Plans

- Fix some bugs (in Known issues)
- Balance changes

## Known Issues
- Damage is definitely too high, it will be lowered soonish.
- If you are in turnabout mode, switching levels will reset your skills to the base skills until you use "Press the witness" again.
- In multiplayer, for some goddamn reason, the normal primary spawns the prefab of the empowered primary and you have people throwing arms around.
- Sometimes, turnabout does not stack if you are not the host of a lobby.
- Stacks will stay even when you start a new game.

## Credits
- Rob's HenryMod -> prevented me from experiencing excruciating pain
- Capcom -> Model & Texturing
- Mixamo -> Animations
- TheTimesweeper -> Hitbox viewer was extremely helpful
- My friends, TeaL & Ethanol 10 who helped me troubleshoot in discord calls.
- The vast amount of Vtuber streams I watched while coding which kept me sane.
