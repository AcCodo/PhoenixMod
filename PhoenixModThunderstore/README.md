## Skills

### Passive: Turnabout
#### <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/399901440023330816/927507829273817088/texBuffIcon.png">
Whenever you hit an enemy with Press The Witness while holding a decisive piece of evidence, gain a stack of turnabout, if you have 50 stacks of turnabout, Phoenix will enter turnabout mode, replacing Phoenix's primary and secondary abilities with empowered versions.

### Primary: Throw Evidence

## Future Plans

## Known Issues
- In multiplayer, for some goddamn reason, the normal primary spawns the prefab of the empowered primary and you have people throwing arms around, this problem only exists for clients.
- If you have the Sett mod installed, it will replace his menu sounds with phoenix wright sounds. (How does this even happen)
